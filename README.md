# The War of Spartacus

This is a game about gladiators in Ancient Rome. It is set in the time of Spartacus and his rebellion for the freedom of slaves. In the story, the player begins as a gladiator slave and must earn his freedom by fighting in the arena. Eventually the player meets Spartacus and can either join him in his war or oppose him and join the Roman legion.
